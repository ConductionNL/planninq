 * lib/base.php from a tree that was never installed still declares `OC` and
 * builds `\OC::$server` before it throws. That server cannot be undone
 * (`OC::$server` is a typed static), so from then on every container lookup in
 * the code under test hits a container that knows none of this app's
 * registrations and autowires from scratch. On 2026-09-08 that recursion took
 * 19 GB of RAM in openregister. The decision therefore has to be made BEFORE
 * base.php is loaded, and the only cheap signal is the `installed` flag.
 *
 * A `dbtype` or `dbhost` key is NOT that signal: a half-written config carries
 * those long before the instance is installed.
 *
 * @param string $ncRoot Candidate Nextcloud root.
 *
