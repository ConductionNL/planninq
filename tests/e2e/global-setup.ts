 * Playwright globalSetup — logs into Nextcloud once and persists the
 * resulting cookie jar / localStorage to `tests/e2e/.auth/admin.json`.
 * Every spec then reuses that storage state via the `use.storageState`
 * setting in playwright.config.ts, so individual tests start from an
 * authenticated session without each one paying the login cost.
 *
 * Why a real browser login (instead of POSTing to /login directly):
 * Nextcloud's login form ships a CSRF token (`requesttoken`) plus a
 * `oc_session_passphrase` cookie that must be set in the same browser
 * context. Driving the form via Playwright sidesteps having to
 * reverse-engineer the token-rotation contract, which has shifted
 * across NC 28 / 29 / 30.
 *
 * Pattern reference: ADR-030 (hydra/openspec/architecture/), mirrored
 * from launchpad's journeydoc setup (the longest-running journeydoc
 * adopter).
