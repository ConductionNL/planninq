# Provision Planninq's OpenRegister register + schemas on a freshly installed
# Nextcloud, for the shared `E2E Tests (Playwright)` CI job.
#
# Wired up as the workflow's `playwright-seed-command`. That step runs AFTER
# `php -S` is up and with cwd set to the Nextcloud server root, so this is
# invoked as:
#
#     playwright-seed-command: 'bash apps/planninq/tests/e2e/ci-seed.sh'
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED
# ------------------
# `occ app:enable planninq` runs the `InitializeSettings` post-migration repair
# step (lib/Repair/InitializeSettings.php), which is supposed to import
# `lib/Settings/planninq_register.json` into OpenRegister. Two things make that
# unreliable as the sole fresh-install path, and BOTH fail silently:
#
#   1. An IRepairStep runs with NO user session. OpenRegister's RBAC evaluates
#      the acting user, so the import is denied outright. This is not a
#      hypothesis for this app — it is the exact message the first attempt at
#      enabling this job recorded (run 30692400428):
#
#          Could not auto-configure Planninq: Failed to import configuration for
#          app planninq: User 'Anonymous' does not have permission to 'create'
#          objects in schema 'Label'
#
#      `InitializeSettings::run()` catches `\Throwable` and downgrades it to
#      `$output->warning(...)`, so `occ app:enable planninq` still exits 0.
#   2. It calls `loadConfiguration(force: false)`. The non-forced path is
#      version-guarded: it can advance the recorded configuration version
#      WITHOUT applying the register, so a second run then sees "already
#      current" and does nothing either.
#
# Either way the app enables cleanly, the SPA boots, and the register simply is
# not there. The e2e suite's failure mode in that state is `[seed] Planninq
# register not reachable` from tests/e2e/fixtures/seed.ts followed by every UI
# spec timing out on a board that has no project to open — messages that accuse
# the fixtures and the selectors, not the missing import.
#
# So this script does the import EXPLICITLY over the admin HTTP API (which has
# a real session and passes RBAC), forced, and then VERIFIES the register and
# schemas actually exist. A failed provision becomes ONE loud step failure here
# instead of a dozen misleading spec failures later.
#
# It is idempotent: the import is idempotent server-side and re-running only
# re-verifies.

# which calls `loadConfiguration(force: true)` — precisely the forced import the
# repair step cannot perform. It is admin-only (no #[NoAdminRequired], plus an
# explicit isCurrentUserAdmin() body check), so HTTP Basic as admin is required.
#
# `OCS-APIRequest: true` is load-bearing, not decoration: the method carries no
# #[NoCSRFRequired], and Nextcloud's Request::passesCSRFCheck() short-circuits
# to true on that header (the strict-cookie precondition is satisfied because a
# Basic-auth request carries no session cookie at all). Without the header this
