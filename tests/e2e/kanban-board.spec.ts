 * E2E (UI-only) coverage for the kanban board due-date warning badge.
 *
 * Back-references the "Due Date Badge on Task Card" requirement scenarios of
 * the archived task-due-date-warning change, now living in
 * openspec/specs/kanban-board/spec.md (gate-19 e2e-coverage):
 *
 *   @e2e kanban-board::approaching-task-shows-yellow-badge
 *   @e2e kanban-board::overdue-task-shows-red-badge
 *   @e2e kanban-board::normal-task-shows-no-badge
 *   @e2e kanban-board::task-without-due-date-shows-no-badge
 *
 * The "Due Date Status Helper" requirement (pure function) is covered by the
 * vitest unit suite (tests/vitest/dueDateStatus.spec.js) and is annotated
 * `@e2e exclude` in the spec — no UI surface to drive.
 *
 * The board surface is seeded by `tests/e2e/global-setup.ts` (via
 * `fixtures/seed.ts`): one project the admin is a member of, its default
 * columns, and a due-date spread of tasks (one approaching, one overdue, one
 * far-future). Only the legitimate "planix not installed" skip remains — once
 * the app answers, the board and its cards MUST be present, so those former
 * skip guards are now hard `expect(...)` assertions.
