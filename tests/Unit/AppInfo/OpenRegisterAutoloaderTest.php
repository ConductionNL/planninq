 * root: an `\Error` thrown while resolving `OCA\OpenRegister\AppHost\Bootstrap`
 * aborts the app's entire `Application::register()`, so every listener
 * registered below it silently never runs. A prelude that can itself throw
 * would reintroduce exactly that failure, so "never throws" is the contract
 * under test — on ANY instance, with OpenRegister present or absent.
