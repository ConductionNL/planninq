/**
 * Renames this app's OpenRegister register SLUG in place, before the import.
 *
 * WHY A REPAIR STEP AT ALL. OpenRegister's ImportHandler resolves a register by
 * SLUG and by nothing else — `registerMapper->find(id: strtolower($data['slug']))`
 * — and the `DoesNotExistException` branch is not an error path, it is the
 * "create a new one" path. So shipping a renamed slug in the register JSON
 * without renaming the row first does not rename anything: the import finds no
 * match, CREATES A SECOND, EMPTY REGISTER, and the app addresses that one from
 * then on. Every stored object stays behind on the old row, reachable by
 * nothing. Nothing errors. The app simply looks new.
 *
 * WHY IT DOES NOT TOUCH A SINGLE OBJECT. An object is bound to its register by
 * NUMERIC ID, not by slug. Every shard table's `_register` column holds the id,
 * and the tables themselves are named
 * `oc_openregister_table_<registerId>_<schemaId>` — OpenRegister composes that
 * name from `$register->getId()` at every call site, and
 * RegisterSchemaLinkageRepairService rejects anything that is not
 * `^[A-Za-z0-9]+_openregister_table_[0-9]+_[0-9]+$`. There is no slug anywhere
 * in the physical layout. Renaming a slug therefore re-points nothing and can
 * strand nothing: it is a one-column UPDATE on one row, and every object,
 * table, schema link and folder follows it untouched.
 *
 * WHY `x-openregister.app` MOVES WITH IT. For a `type: application`
 * configuration, ImportHandler's autoCreateRegisterIfApplication() reads
 * `$slug = $xOpenregister['app'] ?? $appId` — that field IS a register slug, not
 * an attribution label. On planninq it was moved to `planninq` by the app-id
 * rename while the register itself stayed on `planix`, so the two have been
 * disagreeing since; this change closes that gap from the other side.
 *
 * ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING. This runs ahead of everything that resolves a
 * register by slug and ahead of the register import InitializeSettings
 * triggers. It runs after the app-id steps (MigrateAppConfigKeys /
 * MigrateUserPreferences), which move `oc_appconfig` / `oc_preferences` rows and
 * have nothing to do with registers — and whose copied-across `register` value
 * this step then re-points.
 *
 * NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND IDEMPOTENT. It renames only when the old slug is present
 * and the new one is not; a second run finds nothing to do and says so. It
 * refuses rather than merges when both exist, because two rows sharing a slug
 * means the lower id silently wins every lookup, and choosing between them is a
 * decision about data. It never throws: under `<install>` an escaping exception
 * aborts the install and the app never enables at all.
