/**
 * Planninq Migrate App Config Keys Repair Step
 *
 * Repair step that carries this app's stored `IAppConfig` values across the
 * `planix` -> `planninq` app-id rename.
 *
 * Nextcloud namespaces `IAppConfig` by app id at the storage layer
 * (`oc_appconfig.appid`), so renaming `<id>` does not rename the rows — it
 * makes every previously stored value unreachable, because the app now asks
 * for them under a different app id. There is no in-place app-id upgrade in
 * Nextcloud: the new id is simply a different app. This step therefore copies
 * each value from the old namespace to the new one.
 *
 * WHY EVERY KEY RATHER THAN A FIXED LIST. `SettingsService` writes its admin
 * keys from `ADMIN_CONFIG_DEFAULTS`, but that is not the whole stored set —
 * `RegisterImportService` records the imported register/schema ids, and past
 * releases have written keys this app no longer reads. Enumerating
 * `IAppConfig::getKeys()` is exhaustive by construction and cannot drift out
 * of date the way a hardcoded list does.
 *
 * SAFETY. Idempotent and non-destructive:
 *   - a key is copied only when the old value is non-empty AND the new
 *     namespace does not already hold a value, so an admin edit made after the
 *     rename is never clobbered and a second run is a no-op;
 *   - the old `planix` rows are never deleted, so a rollback to the previous
 *     app id still finds its configuration intact;
 *   - values round-trip as raw strings. `IAppConfig` stores every value as a
 *     string and the typed accessors only coerce on read, so a string
 *     round-trip cannot lose or corrupt a value written by a typed setter;
 *   - every failure is logged and the loop continues. A repair step that
 *     throws aborts the install, and a config value that could not be copied
 *     is not worth failing an install over — the app falls back to its
 *     defaults and the admin can re-enter the setting.
 *
 * Registered under BOTH `<install>` and `<post-migration>` in
 * `appinfo/info.xml`, and before `InitializeSettings` in both — see the
 * ordering comment there.
