/**
 * Planninq RenameTimeEntrySchemaSlug repair step.
 *
 * Moves the time-entry schema's slug from `timeEntry` to `plannedTimeEntry`
 * IN PLACE, before InitializeSettings imports the register.
 *
 * WHY IT MOVES AT ALL. A schema slug is global per organisation, and three apps
 * declared a `timeEntry`: humaniq's HR booking, planninq's project booking, and
 * this app's project booking. `SchemaMapper::find()` matches `LOWER(slug)`,
 * so whichever row it reached first answered for all three. humaniq is the
 * agreed owner of the hours; this app's record is the PLANNING side of one —
 * the task it was booked against, the contractor and the hourly rate — and
 * keeps a `timeEntry` reference to the humaniq booking.
 *
 * OpenRegister's import matches an existing schema by (application, slug):
 * ImportHandler calls `findByApplicationAndSlug()` and creates a NEW schema when that
 * misses. A slug rename in the shipped register fragment therefore does not rename
 * anything — it CREATES a second schema and silently orphans the first, together with
 * every object already written against it. The old schema keeps its shard table and its
 * rows; the app resolves the new id and reads an empty collection. Nothing errors.
 *
 * That is why this step exists and why it must run FIRST. Renaming the row before the
 * import means the import finds the schema it was always going to find, keeps its id,
 * and updates it in place — so the shard table, and the objects in it, stay attached.
 *
 * Idempotent: a no-op once the slug is already namespaced, and a no-op on an install that
 * never had the schema. Refuses when both slugs exist, because picking one would decide
 * which set of objects to abandon — a choice this step must not make silently.
