/**
 * Registers OpenRegister's autoload prefix before AppHost is referenced.
 *
 * ## Why this is needed (ADR-040)
 *
 * `OC_App::getEnabledApps()` does `sort($apps)`, and
 * `Coordinator::registerApps()` walks THAT sorted list calling
 * `OC_App::registerAutoloading($appId, $path)` and then `$app->register()` for
 * one app at a time. So every app's `register()` runs BEFORE the PSR-4 prefix
 * of every alphabetically-LATER app exists.
 *
 * `planninq` happens to sort AFTER `openregister`, so the AppHost
 * `class_exists()` probes in `Application::register()` answer TRUE today — by
 * alphabet alone. That is not a property of this app, it is a property of its
 * NAME: the app id has already moved once (planix -> planninq), and the next
 * rename could put it before `openregister` and turn every probe FALSE. A
 * FALSE there is indistinguishable from OpenRegister being absent, so the app
 * would silently drop its AppHost plumbing on a healthy instance instead of
 * failing.
 *
 * Registering the prefix ourselves makes the outcome independent of the id.
 *
 * Lives in its own class rather than inline in `Application::register()` for
 * two reasons. `Application` cannot be constructed without a Nextcloud DI
 * container, so an inline prelude is unreachable from a unit test, whereas the
 * degraded-path contract here — "this NEVER throws, whatever the instance
 * looks like" — is directly assertable. And it keeps `OCP\Server`,
 * `IAppManager` and `OC_App` out of `Application`, whose coupling is already at
 * the phpmd limit.
 *
 * Mirrors keepiq's `AppInfo\OpenRegisterAutoloader`, deliberately: this is the
 * same fleet-wide hazard and the same fix, and two spellings of it would drift.
 *

	 * MUST be called before any `OCA\OpenRegister\…` reference in
	 * `Application::register()`, including a `class_exists()` probe — the probe
	 * answers FALSE, not "not yet loaded", and a FALSE is indistinguishable
	 * from OpenRegister being absent.
	 *
	 * `OC_App::registerAutoloading()` touches only the autoloader and is
	 * idempotent: it early-returns on an `$alreadyRegistered` key, so calling
	 * this more than once is free.
	 *
	 * Deliberately NOT `IAppManager::loadApp('openregister')`: that marks

	 *              is absent, disabled, or otherwise unresolvable — in which
	 *              case the caller MUST fall through to its degraded path.
	 *
	 * @SuppressWarnings(PHPMD.StaticAccess) OC_App is Nextcloud's legacy
	 * bootstrap class. There is no OCP interface for registering another app's
	 * autoloader, and this runs at the composition root where no container is
	 * available to resolve an adapter from.
